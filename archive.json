We shoudl consider that a client, that's a participant in a Auth/eID infrastructure, may lose its compliance and consequently be banned because of this.

RFC7523 came before \"Dynamic Client Registration\" in RFC7591. But since then the metadata defined in RFC7591, and registered extensions to it, have come to imply a general data model for clients that is useful and used for authorization server implementations, even when the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol isn't in play. That includes jwks/jwks_uri metadata as the place for key(s). OIDC core kinda follows and pushes that pattern too and even 'profiles' RFC7591 somewhat with its definition of `private_key_jwt`.  So, regardless of how a client comes to be configured, the jwks or jwks_uri client metadata fields really have become the de facto for where/how client keys are obtained. I think this draft could acknowledge and/or provide some guidance in that direction. The AS would have one client config recorded for the whole client system and the verification keys for the attestation assertion come from the jwks or jwks_uri fields of that record. \"Trust\" comes from how that client record comes to be configured, but that how is out of scope of this draft. \r\n",

Client deployments are therefore RECOMMENDED to use different client attestations across different authorization servers.\r\n```",
